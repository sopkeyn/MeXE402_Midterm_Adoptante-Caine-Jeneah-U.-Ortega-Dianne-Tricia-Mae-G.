Linear regression is applied when the dependent variable is continuous. It establishes a relationship between one or more independent variables and the dependent variable by fitting a linear equation to the data. The standard form of a simple linear regression equation is expressed as y=mx+by = mx + by=mx+b, where yyy represents the dependent variable, mmm is the slope of the line, xxx is the independent variable, and bbb is the y-intercept. The primary goal of linear regression is to minimize the sum of the squared differences, or residuals, between the observed and predicted values. This method assumes a linear relationship and requires that the residuals be normally distributed.
In contrast, logistic regression is employed when the dependent variable is categorical, particularly binary outcomes. This technique estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a specific category by utilizing the logistic function. The logistic function transforms the output of a linear equation into a value between 0 and 1, making it suitable for binary classification tasks. Parameters in logistic regression are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation, which seeks to maximize the likelihood of observing the given data.
Both regression techniques have extensive applications in practice. Linear regression is commonly used for trend analysis, forecasting, and understanding relationships among variables, while logistic regression is prevalent in scenarios such as medical diagnosis, credit scoring, and predicting consumer behavior. A comprehensive understanding of linear and logistic regression equips analysts with powerful tools to derive actionable insights from data, fostering informed decision-making in various fields.
